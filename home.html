<h4>Easy way to centralize</h4>
<p>Centralized automation refers to the practice of consolidating and managing automation processes from a single, central point within an organization. This approach contrasts with decentralized systems where automation tasks and controls are dispersed across various departments or units. By centralizing automation, organizations can streamline operations, ensure consistency, and reduce redundancy.</p>
